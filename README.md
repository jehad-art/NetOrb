# NetOrb Backend

**NetOrb** is a network security configuration analysis platform designed to automate the discovery, auditing, and hardening of special-purpose infrastructure devices â€” including routers, switches, and firewalls. This backend is built with **FastAPI** and supports agent-based config collection, rule-based security analysis, and cross-device interconnection validation.

## Features

- **Security Analysis Engine**: Detects misconfigurations and missing security best practices per device.
- **Interconnection Checks**: Identifies interconnection issues between devices and applies architecture validation.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles config ingestion, analysis, and secure credential access.
- **Rule-Based Analyzer**:
  - Device-specific rules (e.g., Cisco IOS routers/switches, Juniper, Aruba, etc.)
  - Shared base rules (e.g., telnet enabled, plaintext passwords) in Cisco IOS L2 & L3.
  - Interconnection rules (e.g., trunk mismatches, bypassed security zones)
- **Agent-Compatible**: Works with a lightweight Python agent running inside EVE-NG or other labs.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /devices/submit_config`

Submit a full device configuration JSON for analysis.

- Detects misconfigurations
- Applies device-type specific rules
- Performs interconnection analysis (if other devices exist)

**Returns**:  
```json
{
  "message": "Configuration and analysis received",
  "score": 65,
  "issues": 7,
  "analysis": {
    "misconfigurations": [],
    "missing_recommendations": [],
    "interconnection_issues": []
  }
}
```
### `GET /devices/`

Returns a list of all discovered/provisioned devices.
### `GET /devices/secrets/{ip}`

Returns decrypted credentials for the agent (protected by token auth).
### `POST /devices/discovered`

Registers or updates a discovered device (used by the agent after scanning).
### `GET /interconnection_issues`

Re-analyzes all saved configurations for interconnection issues only.



## Example Rules

Misconfiguration

| Rule ID | Description                                                  | Severity |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| R01   | Telnet is enabled on VTY lines   | High     |
| R03   | enable_plaintext	Enable password stored in plaintext        | High     |
| R09   | nat_no_overload	NAT is used without overload flag   | Medium   |

Missing Recommendations

| Rule ID | Description                                                  | Severity |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| R17   | SSH version 2 not configured   | Medium     |
| R18   | Password encryption service is not enabled   | Medium   |

Interconnection Issues

| Rule ID | Description                                                  | Severity |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| INT01   | Trunk mismatch between connected switch ports   | Medium     |
| INT02   | Trunk port connected to unknown/rogue device   | Medium   |
| INT03   | BPDU Guard / Root Guard misalignment across switches   | High   |
| INT04   | Firewall bypass: traffic reaching app server directly, skipping WAF   | Medium   |

## Agent Integration

# The agent perform
- Device discovery via TCP scanning
- Config extraction via SSH (Netmiko)
- Mode + CDP neighbor parsing
- Posts JSON configs to submit_config for full analysis

# Agent must include:
- cdp_neighbors: output of show cdp neighbors detail
- raw_config: full running config
- interfaces: parsed with mode + neighbor info injected

## Getting Started
### Download the code locally
Using the `git` command from the terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jehad-art/NetOrb.git
```

or by clicking on `Code >> Local >> Download ZIP` on the repository main page.

### Install required Packages
You can install all these dependencies using `pip`:<br>
`Netmiko`<br>
```bash
pip install netmiko 
```
`prettytable`<br>
```bash
python -m pip install -U prettytable 
```
### Implementation code structure
The code structured into the following files:<br>
- `Extract_config.py` (to extract the router configuration to a string variable)<br>
- `Original_config.txt` (the extracted config)<br>
- `Structure_config.py` (to read the extracted config and convert it to final json form)<br>
- `Config_C3745.json` (structure file to be analyzed)<br>
- `Analyze_config.py` (to analyze the structured file line by line and identify the misconfiguration and suggested fixes)<br>
- `Print_config.py` (print the resultant output in a tabular format for human readable)<br>
- `Main.py` (the main file to call all previous functions in and run it)<br>


### Required changes
After installation and preparating the prerequisites, open the `Extract_config.py` file and update the router ip address, username and password to match your set of configured access in the router:<br>
```bash
from netmiko import ConnectHandler
def extract_connfig(output):
    device = ConnectHandler(device_type='cisco_ios', ip='<your router ip>', username='<router username>', password='<router password>')
    output = device.send_command("show run")
    device.disconnect() 
```
Once this done, just open the file `main.py` and run it. or you can make yours and add the following code:<br>
```bash
from extract_config import *
from structure_config import *
from analyze_config import *
from print_config import *
output = ""
extract_connfig(output)
structure(output)
analyze(output)
printing(output)
```

## Expected Output
